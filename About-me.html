		<p> Hello my name is Robert Black JR i am a Jamaican American college student and aspiring Web Developer/Programmer I am currently
			living in sunrise Florida. I have been working with computers for the better part of 16 years, more than half of my life
			and I am looking for the opportunity to turn my life long hobby into a career that can hopefully leave me both economically
			and intellectually satisfied. My current goal is to further my skills and gain a general knowledge of all things computer.
			I hope to one day become the god of all things computer that my non tech savy relatives think I am!</p>
